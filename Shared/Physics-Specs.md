### 🧬 Lumina Control Ballistics
To achieve the "Liquid Motion" specified in the UI-Guidelines:

1. **Smoothing Constant:** Use a `0.15ms` ramp time for all parameter changes to prevent digital clicking.
2. **Velocity Sensitivity:** - Slow drag = Fine-tune (0.1x increments).
   - Fast flick = Rapid scroll (10x increments).
3. **The "L-Anchor" Response:** - Clicking the L logo triggers a 200ms eased-out slide animation for the Telemetry panel.

### 🌠 Grain Radar Physics (Lumina Dust)
1. **Orbital Decay:** Grains should slowly fade out as they reach the edge of the radar to mimic "Atmospheric Entry."
2. **Collision Glow:** When two grains overlap, their brightness increases momentarily to #00B87C (Emerald) to show phase summation.
3. **Link-Sync Ripple:** When Lumina Control sends a "Correction Command," the radar field should subtly contract or expand to show the EQ influence.
