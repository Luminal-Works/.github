### The Vision
Luminal Works explores the synergy between sound and code, focusing on:
* **Digital Audio Tools:** Developing unique plugins designed to solve specific creative hurdles in the mix.
* **Vintage Emulation:** Reimagining the character and warmth of classic analog gear through precise digital modeling.
* **Aesthetic Utility:** Crafting visual interfaces that make complex audio processing intuitive and inspiring.

### Current Projects

* **Lumina Press:** Vintage Motown-style compressor with M/S processing and Inter-Plugin Sync.
* **Lumina Base:** Sub-harmonic foundation plugin for precision low-end gravitational control.
* **Lumina Drive:** Vintage console-style saturation and distortion for adding "atmospheric warmth" and grit.
* **Lumina Dust:** Granular digital convolution plugin for creating vast, atmospheric textures and "lunar" soundscapes.
