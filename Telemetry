## 🛰️ Lumina Link-Sync: Telemetry Protocol

The Link-Sync protocol is the "Deep Space Network" for the Lumina Suite. It allows for bi-directional communication between satellite plugins and the Control Center.

### 1. The Handshake Protocol
* **Detection:** Every Lumina plugin scans the DAW's global memory for the `Lumina_Control_Center` ID.
* **Confirmation:** Upon detection, the UI triggers the #52D396 "Docking" glow.

### 2. Data Transmission (The Uplink)
* **Lumina Press** transmits Gain Reduction (GR) values across 32 frequency bands.
* **Lumina Base** transmits Phase-Alignment status and sub-harmonic intensity.
* **Lumina Dust** transmits Granular Density and Stereo Spread metrics.

### 3. Automated Command (The Downlink)
* **Lumina Control** processes incoming telemetry to generate "Correction Curves."
* These curves are applied as high-precision, low-latency dynamic EQ nodes to ensure the mix never exceeds its "Atmospheric Stability" threshold.
